# trains

I was assigned the following task during my time at the UNCC Coding Bootcamp

      ### Overview

      In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. 
      Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.


The app utilizes firebase to store data of train schedules that is mathematically determined using Moment.JS and
logical JS programming. The app keeps track of the current time and mocks what an actual train schedule would look like.

To complete this assignemnt I used:

HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Firebase
JS 
Moment.JS
